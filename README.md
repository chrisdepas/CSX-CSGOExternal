# CSX

External cheat for CS:GO, with simple engine glow ESP, noflash, and a triggerbot.
This is old and outdated, offsets are probably wrong now, and signatures are most likely broken, these will require updating before this is functional.

Uses Catch v1.11.0 for unit testing (Catch2 dropped support for VS2012)

# Controls
- Holding Capslock enables triggerbot
- Holding F7 forces glow ESP to render while localplayer is dead
- Press F6 to exit

# Building / Running
- Works on windows only and requires VS2012 or newer
- Build in visual studio, run and launch CSGO
